Exercise 1, part 1 and 2

### Part 1:
In order to run the code on a certain size create a txt file called ‘size’ and write ‘size=n’ where n I the desired size and run the code which is called "ex1.py". 
Output will come out as a txt file under the name “results_n=size_a” and print to the terminal.


### Part 2:
In order to run the code with a specific graph and size create a txt file called ‘graph’ and write ‘size=n’ where n I the desired size, and then in new lines write each edge that graph has. Run the code which is called "ex1a.py".

Output will come out as a txt file under the name “results_n=size_b” and print to the terminal.
